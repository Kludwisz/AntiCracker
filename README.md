# AntiCracker-S

A stronger, more invasive version of the standard AntiCracker Fabric mod.

Scrambles all loot table seeds of chests in various structures, as well as the generation of structure positions, structure layouts, structure decoration, features, world carvers, and end pillars. 

This version effectively disables all potential seedcracking methods I'm aware of, at the cost of limited parity between the unmodified and modified version of Minecraft (the only unaffected aspects of world generation are biomes and terrain).
