# AntiCracker

A Fabric mod that scrambles the loot table seeds used by chests in various structures using a hash of the Minecraft world seed, making loot-table-based seedcracking algorithms take infeasibly long.

While the mod affects loot table seeding, it does not affect the loot tables themselves, nor other areas of Minecraft world generation.
